# wheel-of-lunch
A tool for picking where to eat


The file you want is "Bin\Wheel-Of-Lunch-0_0_1.zip"

Unzip the contents to a folder and run "Wheel-of-Lunch.bat"

The program will then pick a restaurant in Prince Albert to eat at.


Change "restfile.txt" in your contents folder to change the list of restaurants.

Each line must contain one restaurant.
